  If the resulting refund is less than 14.95 the refund will not be issued but no further charges for the remaining will be charged. </p>
<p>Why wasn't I told about the charge?<br />

  MD Software saves to a server operated by MD or a MD Affiliate an encrypted copy of each file you designate.

You agree that MD and MD Affiliates may retain (but shall have no obligation to retain) your Backup Data for a period after your trial or license has been terminated, expired, or otherwise lapsed, as part of MD's marketing to you of the opportunity to purchase, renew, or extend a license.

  15. Data Collection, Encryption, Privacy, and Disclosure<br />
  MD will collect and use Personal Information in accord with the terms of our MD Privacy Policy , which is incorporated into and made a part of these Terms and Conditions of Use. You hereby consent to MD's use of your Personal Information under the terms of the MD Privacy Policy, as it may be amended from time to time. To provide its services, MD Software routinely scans your computer in order to detect new, modified, or deleted data files that require further action to complete backup and restore operations. MD Software also catalogs the number and total storage size of various file types on your computer. MD Software inspects file headers and related information in order to confirm that each file's type is properly represented by its file extension. The contents of your files are encrypted before they are transmitted to MD's data center. MD may have the ability to decrypt your data files. However, MD will not decrypt your files unless i) it reasonably believes that it must do so to troubleshoot problems with the MD Services or ii) it reasonably believes it must do so in order to comply with a law, subpoena, warrant, order, or regulation, including, without limitation, the requirement of a certification that complies with 18 U.S.C. - 2703. MD may also provide access to your data to government authorities if MD suspects or believes that the data contains child pornography or other prohibited data or that the data is being used for illegal purposes. You acknowledge that MD or MD Affiliates may use servers and other equipment to provide the MD Products or Services that are located in the United States or in other countries where litigants, law enforcement, courts, and other agencies of the government may have the right to access data stored within their jurisdictions upon terms and conditions provided by local law, and that as a result, they may gain access to your Backup Data as provided by applicable local law. You may elect to Use MD Products or Service that permit you to decrypt and download Backup Data from any Internet enabled computer. You understand that by electing to access your files from a computer other than the one you used to create the Backup Data, that your Backup Data will be decrypted by MD in its data center and sent to you in a decrypted format via public infrastructure. You acknowledge that this may cause the contents of these files to become accessible to individuals other than you and that you accept this risk. You further acknowledge that depending upon the MD Product or Service you use or the features of the MD Product or Service you use, accessing your Backup Data from any Internet enabled computer may not be possible.</p>
